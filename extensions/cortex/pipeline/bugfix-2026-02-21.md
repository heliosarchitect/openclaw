# Bugfix Pass — 2026-02-21

## Checks Run

- TypeScript compile check:
  - `cd ~/Projects/helios && npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head -50`
  - Result: clean (no output/errors).
- Synapse blocked pipeline scan:
  - Reviewed recent inbox messages for blocked stage reports.
  - Result: no currently blocked active pipeline stage requiring intervention.
- Recent git health review:
  - `git log --oneline -n 12` reviewed.
  - Result: recent fixes/tests appear coherent; no obvious revert loops requiring immediate patch.
- Python syntax checks:
  - `python3 -m py_compile $(git ls-files '*.py')` in:
    - `~/Projects/helios/extensions/cortex`
    - `~/Projects/augur-trading`
  - Result: clean.

## Fixes Applied

- No code fixes required this cycle.

## Notes

- Pipeline state had no active task. Proceeded to create the next feature task from IMPROVEMENT_PLAN (Phase 2.2) and started requirements stage under `task-018-memory-consolidation`.

- No code fixes required this cycle.

## Pipeline Repair/Progress (15:00 ET cycle)

- Detected state inconsistency: `task-018-memory-consolidation` remained in `active_tasks` with `current_stage=done`.
- Normalized pipeline state by marking task-018 as completed and moving it to `completed_tasks`.
- Created next feature task from IMPROVEMENT_PLAN:
  - `task-019-shared-cortex-architecture` (Phase 3.1)
  - Stage initialized to `requirements` with bugfix complete.
