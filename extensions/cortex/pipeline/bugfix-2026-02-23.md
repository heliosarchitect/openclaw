## Scope

Daily bugfix-first pass for pipeline orchestrator and core repos.

## Checks executed

1. TypeScript compile check (helios):
   - `cd ~/Projects/helios && npx tsc --noEmit`
   - Result: **PASS** (no diagnostics)

2. Python syntax checks:
   - `cd ~/Projects/helios && python3 -m py_compile extensions/cortex/python/*.py`
   - `cd ~/Projects/augur-trading && python3 -m py_compile *.py`
   - `cd ~/Projects/wems-mcp-server && python3 -m py_compile *.py`
   - Result: **PASS** (no syntax errors)

3. Synapse blocked-signal scan:
   - Reviewed inbox for pipeline/security/test block indicators.
   - Result: no new unresolved stage-block messages requiring intervention.

4. Recent git log scan:
   - Recent fixes include pipeline artifact/path consistency and cortex SQL hardening.
   - No immediate regression signatures detected in latest commits.

## Issues found + fixed

### 1) Pipeline state consistency drift (fixed)

- Symptom: multiple tasks had `current_stage=done` and deploy completed, but `status` remained `active`/`planned` and `done` was missing from `stages_completed` in some entries.
- Fix applied in `pipeline/state.json`:
  - Set `status=completed` for done-stage tasks
  - Ensured `done` included in `stages_completed`
  - Set `completed_at` timestamp where absent
- Tasks reconciled: task-020 through task-040 (21 tasks).

## Outcome

- Bugfix pass complete.
- No compile/syntax blockers.
- Pipeline state consistency restored for done tasks.
